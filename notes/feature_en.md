### Implemented Security Aspects

1. **Token-Based Authentication**:
   - Utilizes **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** and **PASETO (Platform-Agnostic Security Tokens)** for secure authentication, ensuring that only authenticated users can access protected resources.

2. **Token Renewal**:
   - Implements an **automatic token renewal** mechanism that ensures authentication tokens are renewed before they expire, maintaining secure and continuous sessions.

3. **Automatic Logout on Inactivity**:
   - Implements **automatic logout** after a defined period of inactivity, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access if a user forgets to log out.

4. **Secure Token Storage**:
   - Utilizes **sessionStorage** to store authentication tokens, which is more secure than localStorage as tokens do not persist after the browser is closed.

5. **Route Protection in Frontend**:
   - Uses route guards in Vue Router to ensure that only authenticated users can access protected routes, redirecting unauthenticated users to the login page.

6. **Password Hashing in Frontend**:
   - Uses **CryptoJS** to hash passwords in the frontend before sending them to the server, ensuring passwords are not transmitted in plain text.

7. **Session Validation on the Server**:
   - Continuously verifies tokens in the backend to ensure that only valid tokens can access protected APIs.

8. **Authorization Headers**:
   - Implements `Authorization` headers with the `Bearer` prefix when sending tokens to the server, following standard API security practices.

9. **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**:
   - Configures **CORS** on the server to allow only specific origins, preventing unauthorized requests from different origins.

10. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**:
    - (Optional) Implements a **Content Security Policy** on the server to prevent XSS attacks by restricting the types of content that can be loaded.

### Additional Recommended Security Aspects

- **Protection Against XSS and CSRF**:
  - Implement additional protections against **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** and **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** in the backend.

- **Monitoring and Logging**:
  - Set up proper monitoring and logging to detect and respond to suspicious activities in real-time.

- **Use of HTTPS**:
  - Ensure the application is served over **HTTPS** to protect data in transit between the client and the server.
